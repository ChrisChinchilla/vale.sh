data:
  - scope: "`heading`"
    description: |
      Matches all `<h{1,...}>` tags. You can specify an exact level by 
      appending tagsâ€”for example, `heading.h1` matches all `h1` tags.

  - scope: "`table.header`"
    description: "Matches all `<th>` tags."

  - scope: "`table.cell`"
    description: "Matches all `<td>` tags."

  - scope: "`table.caption`"
    description: "Matches all `<caption>` tags."

  - scope: "`figure.caption`"
    description: "Matches all `<figcaption>` tags."

  - scope: "`list`"
    description: "Matches all `<li>` tags."

  - scope: "`paragraph`"
    description: |
      Matches all paragraphs (segments of text separated by two newlines).

  - scope: "`sentence`"
    description: |
      Matches all sentences. **Note:** This scope is computationally expensive
      and should only be used for rules that require sentence-level 
      granularity (such as counting words per sentence).

  - scope: "`blockquote`"
    description: "Matches all `<blockquote>` tags."

  - scope: "`alt`"
    description: "Matches all alt attributes."

  - scope: "`summary`"
    description: |
      Matches all body text (excluding headings, code spans, code blocks, and 
      table cells). This scope is useful for rules that need to match only 
      sentence-level text content (such as readability scores).

  - scope: "`raw`"
    description: |
      Uses the raw, unprocessed markup source instead of a specific scope. This
      scope is useful for regex-based rules that need to match against the 
      original source text.
